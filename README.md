**Project Outline**
The purpose of this project was to interface a microcontroller, the Tiva TM4C123, with external hardware
components. This consisted of a 16 x 2 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and a 4 x 4 keypad. Utilising this
hardware, and the programming language ‘C’. The goal was to design and implement the software to act in
conjunction with the interfaced hardware to create a calculator able to perform simple mathematical
calculations. With the keypad acting as an input, the user inputs numbers and operators which were then fed
into the microcontroller with the resultant output being displayed on the LCD screen.
